This project is a simple yet engaging multiplayer dice game developed in C++. 
The game allows multiple players to take turns rolling a virtual dice, accumulating scores over time.
However, there’s a twist: any player whose score reaches or exceeds 20 points is immediately eliminated from the game.
The process continues until only one player remains, who is declared the winner.
The project demonstrates the use of core C++ concepts such as loops, conditional statements, arrays (or vectors), functions, and random number generation.
It also introduces basic game logic, user interaction, and elimination rules, making it both fun to play and educational to code.


Rules:
1.	The game starts with a fixed number of players (input from the user).
2.	Players take turns rolling a dice.
3.	A dice roll generates a random number between 1 and 6.
4.	The roll value is added to the player’s total score.
5.	If a player’s score is 20 or more, they are eliminated immediately.
6.	Turns continue for the remaining players until only one player is left.
7.	The last remaining player is declared the winner.
